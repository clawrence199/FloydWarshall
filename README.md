# FloydWarshall
 Implementation of Floyd Warshall's algorithm.
 This program uses Java and Swing to create a gui which reads in a text file.
 The text file should be properly formatted(see exampleTest.txt) with community names
 and the known distances between them.  The user is then able to save a text file 
 containing a list of each pair of communities and the shortest distance between them.
 If the communities are not connected the distance will display 2000000.
